# Project

I would like to say thank you again for the oppertunity to create this project, and I would like to emphasize how much I enjoyed this course. 

For this game I created a horror game, around lebubu's. This was a terrible idea, but fun to make. I felt as though this challenge would demonstrate a multitude of skillsets; dynamic environment with particle and sound systems, a tracking entity, movement, etc. 

> [!NOTE]
> If there are any issues with compilation please let me know so I can setup LFS for github, I dont believe the excluded assets were of any use to the project but It could be worth mentioning.

I could not find any friends to record the gameplay, since everyone has now left, so I hope this gameplay is acceptable.


Audio wasnt recorded, but is present in game
